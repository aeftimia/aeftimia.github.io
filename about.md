Hi, my name is Alex Eftimiades. I like math and programming. I work in the "write software that does math" industry.

I also like research. I've found I prefer self study to classes, and I ultimately decided against going to graduate school for this reason. Though I do sometimes read the textbooks. Fortunately the computer industry, while not perfect, has a _weirdly_ meritocratic subculture. This is at least partly what drew me into it professionally.

I've made a habit of automating the boring parts of my job and spend a fair amount of time keeping up with the latest machine learning research. I'm always open to shrinking $\epsilon$ while killing the "do fun stuff" and "not starve" birds with $1 + \epsilon$ stones, but I do take pride in being able to efficiently deploy my own models.

I'm most at home programming in Python, which remains a swiss army knife (because I'm _nothing_ like those 90s Perl hackers...), but I'm comfortable working in any language with first class functions.

Feel free to reach out if you're a long lost relative that wants to split a family fortune in exchange for a small loan up front. I've made _so much money_ helping distant royal relatives!
